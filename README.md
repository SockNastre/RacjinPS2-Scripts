Requires Python 3

## Information

All batch scripts here run through Python scripts in "pyscripts" folder. The batch script is useful for multiple file dragging and dropping, otherwise the Python scripts can just be used. Inside of "miscscripts" are scripts that are related to Racjin PS2 games but mainly unspecific towards acceptable data.

If you want to get into contact with anyone involved with these scripts, the best place to get in contact is the [Naruto Classic's Discord](https://discord.gg/jhKmg97).

### raw_unpack.bat / unpack_decompressed_raw.py
Drag and drop decompressed .raw file onto the script file, it will output the unpacked assets (or "sections") from the archive into the same folder as the decompressed .raw file.

### raw_text_parse.bat / parse_raw_text.py
Drag and drop decompressed .raw text file (with asset, "section", metadata or not) onto script. In the same folder a .txt file of the same name will generate with the decoded text.

Thanks to those on the [Naruto Classic's Discord](https://discord.gg/jhKmg97) (such as William Vaz, Theus, NarutoClassics, and more) for creating the encoding table for the text encoding used in these games.
